# Test Agent Web App

This repository contains a simple static web application consisting of an `index.html` page and a `style.css` stylesheet. The project demonstrates a minimal HTML and CSS setup that can be hosted using GitHub Pages or any static file server.

## How to Host on GitHub Pages

1. Commit your code to the `main` branch (or any branch you choose).
2. In your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to **Pages**.
3. Choose the branch to publish (commonly `main`) and set the source directory to `/`.
4. Save the settings. GitHub will build and deploy your site, making it available at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

Open `index.html` in a browser to see the page locally or after deployment to view it online.
